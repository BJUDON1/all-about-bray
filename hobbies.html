        Hi, my name is Braylen. I was born and raised in Oxford, MS. I went to the Oxford school district all my life. I love hanging out with my friends, working out, and playing video games. I'm a chill guy who is interested in learning new things for myself. Oh yeah, my favorite rapper is NBA Youngboy, he's the goat. I'm a big-time believer in God; without him, nothing is possible, so I take trusting in him very seriously. Before Basecamp, my plans were to go to Ole Miss. But my god brother told me about Basecamp, and the pros outweighed Ole Miss, so at the last minute, I told my high school counselor Can you please set up a meeting with them. I think Basecamp is going great so far. We already had bumps, but that's what comes with a good opportunity. So I'm blessed and very thankful for where I'm at.
